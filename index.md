### CPSC 120

* Lab 3, part 1 was a favourite because I was impressed about how we can create a code that can take different inputs each time and it would print out a different output depending on what the person chose as their protein, condiment, and bread. I was confused at first on how to write the code because I didn't fully understand the concept of cin and cout.However, I was able to understand how to apply them in later codes because of practice.

* Lab 6, part 2 was a favourite because I was able to use do-while loops. I had a harder time debugging this code because I didn't get the expected output for some of the test cases but I was able to figure it out later. I was also able to use nested if statements which were challenging to implement because it was my first time applying them. It was very interesting how we were able to create a small game with a code that has less than 60 lines.

* Lab 12, part 1 was a favourite because I was impressed on how we were able to create a gradient image using the Magick Library. I wasn't able to figure it out right away because I didn't understand how to write one of the functions but I asked for help and I was able to figure it out. It was fascinating to see how multiple images that are added together can create a smooth and color-changing image.
